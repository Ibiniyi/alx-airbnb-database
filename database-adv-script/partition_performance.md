Step-by-Step Testing Plan
üß™ 1. Sample Query for Performance Testing
Use a query that filters by the partition key (start_date):

sql
Copy
Edit
-- Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to measure performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT *
FROM bookings
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-06-30';
üïµÔ∏è 2. Compare with Non-Partitioned Table
Before partitioning, run the same query on bookings_old:

sql
Copy
Edit
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT *
FROM bookings_old
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-06-30';
Compare:

Execution time

Rows scanned

Scan type (should be Seq Scan for old, Partition Range or Index Scan for new)

üìù Performance Report
üßæ Test Setup
Database: PostgreSQL 15+

Data Volume: ~1 million rows in bookings_old

Partitioning: bookings partitioned by start_date using yearly RANGE partitions.

üìä Observations
Metric	bookings_old (Unpartitioned)	bookings (Partitioned)
Scan Method	Sequential Scan	Partition Pruning + Index/Seq Scan
Rows Scanned	~1,000,000	~250,000
Execution Time	~850 ms	~130 ms
Planning Time	~4 ms	~8 ms

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: These numbers are for illustrative purposes. Actual performance depends on hardware, DB engine, and indexing.

‚úÖ Improvements Observed
Partition Pruning: The query only scanned the relevant partition (bookings_2024).

Lower I/O: Less data was read into memory.

Faster Execution: Up to 6x improvement in query time for date-based filtering.

Better Scalability: As more data accumulates, partitioning prevents slowdowns by isolating date ranges.

üß† Recommendation
Use range partitioning when your table:

Is very large

Is frequently queried by a date range

Has archivable or historical records (e.g., monthly/yearly)
